# HySE_CoRegistration

First attempts at creating a pipeline to co-registrate images for the HySE study.

As a first step, use test data (moving hand imaged with old endoscope) to come up with a preliminary pipeline (in a jupyter notebook) to start from once we have actual data.
Using the images from HySE_HypercubeFunctions for pre-analysis.

Uses simples elastix, documentation available here:

Can plot figure to look at static and co-registered images:
